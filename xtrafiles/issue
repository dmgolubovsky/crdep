This is your Chrome Remote Desktop Endpoint "\n" boot.

Log in as root. The password is 'crdep'.
Authorize your endpoint if prompted.

Type crd-auth at the root prompt if you need to reauthorize it.

The boot image is mutable, so you can make the necessary changes such as adjust the appearance,
connect with your online accounts, etc.

After you are done setting it up, type "poweroff" at the root command prompt, then proceed
to finalize your endpoint.

Enjoy!
